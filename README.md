This is going to be a collection of my favorite games, starting with black jack.

I would like to make them multiplayer and able to play with/against AI.

Some more games I would like to add:
Texas Holdem
Bones(dominoes)
7-card gin


<b>bugs to fix:</b>
- what happens when dealer or player gets dealt two aces
    -ace equals [1, 11] now.
    -dealers first ace equals 11, the rest equal 1
    -not sure how to fix players ace issue
    - should I make a function to check a hand for an ace 
- should I not update count in dealCard()? 
- create image elements for cards in JS instead of HTML
